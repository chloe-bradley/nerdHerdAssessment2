					<p>More employees are being replaced by machines. It is estimated that 44 per cent of Australian 
						jobs are highly susceptible to automation, as industries modernise their workforces. 
						In America, researchers predict 47 per cent of jobs will be automated by 2030. 
						(Source: industry.gov mechanical-boon)</p>
					<p>The worldwide Robotic Process Automation Software market grew 63% to $846 million in 2018, 
						making it the fastest-growing segment of the global enterprise software market. 
						The top 5 RPA software companies include UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, 
						NICE and Pegasystems. It is predicted that RPA software revenue will reach $1.3 billion in 2019. 
						(Source: Gartner, Inc.) </p>
					<p> Intelligent Automation: The RPA market, while only $250 million in 2016, 
						is estimated to grow to $2.9 billion in 2021. With advancements in AI, 
						RPA will be able to evolve from exclusively focusing on rote tasks, to more complex ones. 
						There will be an increased AI presence in the digital workforce (Source: Forrester </p>
						<p> In Australia, the number of people working as Industrial, Mechanical and Production 
							Engineers stayed about the same over 5 years: from 30,200 in 2014 to 30,100 in 2019. 
							This does not account for statistics due to Covid-19. (Source: joboutlook.gov Industrial,
							 Mechanical and Production Engineers) </p>
							 <p>After conducting further research into the industry, I have found a limited number 
								 of jobs in comparison to other IT fields. However, this field has a very high 
								 long-term potential when it comes both to business and career opportunities.  </p>
							 <p>According to (Office of the Chief Economist, 2015) it is estimated that 44 percent 
								 Australian jobs are highly susceptible to automation. In my personal view this new 
								 progressive field is much more appealing and is guaranteed to last for the 
								 remainder of my lifetime.  </p>

					<p>Solutions Architects continue to be an in-demand job in businesses, 
						serving as consultants to their clients, offering specialised skills in designing and 
						integrating information systems and optimising a company’s software portfolio. 
						As more companies move to the Cloud, architects will help build the digital 
						infrastructure and assess vulnerabilities in this new environment. (Source: Hired.com)</p>
					<p> In Australia, the predicted growth for Solutions Architect jobs is 23.4% over the next 5 years.(Source: Labour Market Information Portal) </p>
					<p>Companies that are hiring Solutions Architects includes Cisco, Elastic, Innodev, AWS, Telstra, 
						The Network IT, Rio Tinto, Department of Defence, Experian and Zoom.  
						Fortune 500 companies and world class brands such as Guinness, Walt Disney, and Universal, 
						all require the services of architects to improve their digital strategies and create 
						comprehensive product roadmaps.  Glassdoor advertised 55,000 Solution Architect roles in 
						August 2020. (Source Glassdoor) </p>
						<p>Solution Architecture is a key component of any enterprise, delivering value by 
							finding solutions and requirements for software, solution options (e.g. through RFIs, 
							RFPs or prototype development) and solutions for building and implementing plans.

							<p>The number of people working as Game Developers stayed about the same over 5 
								years from 690 in 2011 to 650 in 2016. This is a very small occupation. 
								Most game developers work in the field of education, science, information media 
								and telecommunications. Game developers work with animators and illustrators to 
								creates digital animations, images, video clips, and internet applications using  
								a range of software, tools and programming languages such as Java, Python, C, C++ and C#.

									Sony Entertainment, UbiSoft, Sega and Electronic Arts. Companies in Australia 
									include Acheron Design, Krome Studios, Redtribe, Tantalus Media and Torus Games. 
									(Source: Ranker).</p>
									<p>My original idea of my ideal job was a bit mixed. It was Game developer 
										and Technical Architect. I like the gaming aspect due to my hobby, 
										but after looking at job prospects and burning glass data, I have changed 
										my goal to be solely working towards the job of a Solutions Architect.   </p>
										<p>The same reason as before, SA’s work from multiple perspectives 
											including business, information and technologies to resolve solutions. 
											It will require an understanding in a broad range of topics, an eye on 
											the future and business sense. Solutions Architects are given a 
											lot of managing responsibilities and layout plans for departments to follow. 
											If a company needs to progress their technologies, I would decide on how 
											o implement them and maximise the benefits.  </p>
											<p>I did not realise that it led to the top-ranking job on Burning 
												Glass (Solutions Architect), nevertheless I like the idea to be 
												given a problem or idea, figure it out, implement it and help 
												integrate it into the company.   </p>

					<p>Software Engineering was ranked as the number one most in-demand job in the Information Technology sector. 
						(Source: Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) </p>
					<p>The employment of software developers is projected to grow 22 percent from 2019 to 2029.

						computer software as industries become automated and more reliant on computer systems. 
						(Source: U.S Bureau of Labour Statistics)   </p>
					<p>Among all IT products and services, Enterprise Software grew at an 11.1% rate in 2017 and is expected to grow at an 8.4% rate in 2019. (Source Garter) </p>
					<p>Today, the world runs on software and the people who create it. As of 2018, there are 23 million
						 software developers worldwide. This population is expected to grow to 27.7 million by 2023. 
						 The US is the birthplace of software development and has therefore always had the largest 
						 developer population. However, there is strong growth is in countries like China, India and 
						 Brazil. China is the top nation for growth, with a developer population rise forecasted to 
						 range between 6% and 8% each year leading up to 2023. India is set to take over the US in

						 <p>Some of the world’s largest companies hire software engineers. 
							 These include Google, Samsung, IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Oracle, Apple, 
							 Intel, Yahoo, SonSoft and SAP.</p>
							 <p>My decision to focus on being a software engineer has solidified after reading 
								 the industry data. This field is exactly what I wanted and more. 
								 I didn’t know there were 23 million software engineers in the world today. 
								 They created the foundation of what our lives are – our banking, shopping, 
								 agriculture, stocks, music, videos – nearly everything! Without computers, 
								 society would fall apart.  </p>
								 <p>Software engineering is growing so rapidly and in such high demand, 
									 the odds of getting a fun and interesting job is very high if I apply 
									 myself and gain expertise in my chosen field of interest – UI design. 
									 Software engineering is projected to grow 22 percent from 2019 to 2029. 
									 That is faster than most jobs.  </p>
									 <p>The new inventions and applications that are being developed make 
										 software engineering an exciting realm to be in. I hope to work in one 
										 of the most innovative companies on the planet – Google – and one day 
										 apply my knowledge to create products that give customers a great user

					<p><h4>Quantum Researcher </h4></p>
					<p>Quantum technologies are going to create incredible research opportunities throughout the world. 
						Businesses in Australia are set to generate over $4 billion and create 16,000 jobs by 2040. 
						Our Quantum Computing industry is predicted to be worth $2.5B and produce 10K jobs. 
						Globally, quantum technologies are projected to create an estimated $86 billion by 2040 
						(Growing Australia’s Quantum Technology Industry - CSIRO, 2020). </p>
					<p>Quantum research opportunities range in industries from technology companies such as Google, 
						IBM and Microsoft, to the defence, mining and medical sectors. Some examples of how quantum 
						research is used commercially include drug discovery and development, as well as materials 
						development. Research will be enabled by accurate chemical simulations that can be built on 
						a quantum computer. The level of computation in classical computers cannot comprehend the 
						complex structure of most molecules. Quantum technologies are creating stable and highly 
						precise sensors for mineral exploration, water and energy management. Quantum-encryption 
						will enhance security for classified data and communications (Fisher, 2020). </p>
					<p>Many governments are implementing investment programs to develop and expand their quantum 
						industries. Since 2017, at least 5 nations have created billion-dollar scale quantum 
						technology research and development initiatives. China is one of the largest investors, 
						reported to be spending $14.7 billion to build the world’s largest quantum research facility. 
						China has also been in the forefront of quantum research, being the first to create a quantum
						communications satellite and quantum encryption technology (Growing Australia’s Quantum 
						Technology Industry - CSIRO, 2020).</p>
						<p> Companies that employ quantum researchers includes IBM, Intel, Google, Microsoft, 
							Amazon, Lockheed Martin, CSIRO, Archer, Q-CTRL, Silicon Quantum Computing, MOGlabs, 
							D-wave systems, NASA, Quantum Brilliance, Rigetti Computing and QuintessenceLabs. 
							There is a steady number of new venture capital research companies that will emerge 
							and take advantage of this new technology (ltd, 2020).</p>
							<p>Governments all over the world, from the United States, to the UK to Australia, 
								are laying the foundations for a future quantum internet (Ananthaswamy, 2020).</p>
								<p>My desire to become a quantum researcher has increased after analysing all 
									the industry data. It was exciting to read CSIRO’s “Growing Australia’s 
									Quantum Technology Industry” 2020 report. Quantum technologies are going to 
									create many avenues for job growth and increase Australia’s economy, injecting 
									a possible $4 billion dollars.  </p>
								<p>Australia’s mining sector will greatly benefit from quantum research. 
									The new materials and drugs that will be made by learning more about the 
									mathematical connections between electrons will be enormous. For example, 
									the simple caffeine molecule is too complex for a classical computer to decipher, 
									but it is hoped a quantum computer will be able to generate an accurate simulation. 
									I’m also interested to see how quantum computers will provide solutions to the 
									environmental sector, helping reverse the effects of climate change, clean up oceans 
									and protect wildlife from extinction.  </p>
								<p>Quantum computing is just getting started. Two decades ago, it was a purely 
									theoretical field. Currently, University of NSW is the only higher education 
									institution in the world that has a degree in quantum computing. </p>
									<p>But as more research and technologies are released for commercial use, 
										including a quantum internet, more interest and investments will be given 
										to quantum computing. The sector will grow and prove to be revolutionary in 
										the next few decades.</p>

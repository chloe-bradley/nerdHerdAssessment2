			<ul class="project_items">
				<h4>Overview</h4>	
				<a><p>
					The format and delivery of education has remained largely unchanged for the last 100 years. 
					Mobius Education (named after the surface with only one side, pictured above) transforms the 
					subject of mathematics into a journey of wonder, fun and exhilaration. It's maths education for 
					the 21st century child using the latest technologies including AI, machine learning, virtual 
					reality, augmented reality, gaming, animation and HD video including animated eBooks. 
					The student (player) is transported from their classroom into worlds where they see how maths 
					really works. No more tedious, boring classrooms where teachers talk for hours and scribble on 
					a blackboard. At Mobius, children learn maths in an interactive and natural manner, making 
					them fall in love with the beauty of formulas and calculations. By the end of the course, 
					students will achieve a high level of mathematical fluency and be able to flourish in an ever 
					evolving world. 
				</p>
				</a>
				<h4>Motivation</h4>
				<h3>Maths fluency is low</h3>
				<a><p>
					Maths is a language, like English, but even employed people have problems understanding and 
					speaking it. According to data from ‘Programme for the International Assessment of Adult 
					Competencies (PIAAC),’ employed people aged 15 to 64 years who worked in 'Professional, 
					Scientific and Technical Services' had numeracy skills that were high (70% at Level 3 or above), 
					but those working in Construction, Administration and Manufacturing were low (44%, 39% and 42% 
					at Level 3 or above respectively).
					Numeracy levels among the general Australian population (both employed and unemployed), were low. 
					Close to 6.5% (1.1 million) of Australians had numeracy skills at Below Level 1, 15% (2.5 million) 
					at Level 1, 32% (5.4 million) at Level 2, 31% (5.2 million) at Level 3, 11% (1.8 million) at Level 4 
					and 1.4% (230,000) at Level 5.2 

					<img src="img/graph1.jpeg" alt="Figure 3. Proportion of Australians at each numeracy level(2011-12).2">
					<cite>Figure 3. Proportion of Australians at each numeracy level(2011-12). </cite>
				</p>
				</a>
				<h3>Costs of innumeracy </h3>
				<a><p>
					Mathematics has allowed society to advance to a point where the average lifespan of a child born 
					in 2000 is 100 years old.3 Without mathematical skills, engineering and science will not progress, 
					leading to stagnation and serious consequences to our species in the event of a global pandemic or 
					natural disaster such as a volcanic eruption or asteroid collision. Today there is growing shortage 
					of qualified people in the STEM fields. Much of this has to do this a lack of mathematical knowledge.

				</p>
				</a>

				<a><p>
					The inability to rationally understand statistics, large numbers, graphs and probabilities 
					has also resulted in a population that can be easily manipulated and misinformed in areas of 
					great importance - governmental policies, personal life decisions, medicine and finance. 
					Pseudoscience and conspiracy theories are rising and the recent Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted 
					this well. It is more crucial than now than ever to possess a clear, logical way of looking 
					at the world. It is literally a life or death situation at the moment. Lastly, mathematically 
					competent people tend to be wealthier. People with higher scores in numeracy make more money 
					from wages and salaries. In the PIAAC study, 89% of Australian high-income earners had a numeracy 
					level of 3 or higher, compared to only of 29% of low-income earners.

				</p>
				</a>

				<h4>Motivation</h4>
				<h3>THE DESIGNER COURSE: Neuroimaging and Psychometric tests</h3>
				<a><p>
					Mobius Maths is a custom designed course for Prep to University students using the latest 
					technologies with lifetime access. To personalise maths education, each child firstly undergoes 
					a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan to see how blood flows to their brain. 
					We check for any abnormalities and problems every year and enter the data into a brain bank, 
					which a student can access on our online platform. A healthy, well-functioning brain is the 
					foundation of education and a happy life. When the brain is troubled, a child will struggle 
					to be their best selves. Based on the results, the child will be given an AI designed brain 
					diet including supplements (Omega 3 fatty acids, multi-vitamins, etc) and an exercise regime 
					to maximise mental performance. The food that we eat and the amount of exercise we do has a 
					profound effect on how our brain functions.</p>
				</a>

				</div>

				<a><p>
					Afterwards, the child takes a psychometric test, beginning in Prep and every 6 
					months afterwards until they finish the course. The results will be part of a training 
					data set for AI to learn from. Algorithms will generate a personalised course suited to the 
					child’s character, personal interest and learning style. As the student changes and grows, so 
					too does the course, creating a flexible and ever evolving learning environment. She can learn 
					and progress through the course at her own speed. Learning is not a race. Having a deep 
					understanding of maths is the priority at Mobius. 
				</p>
				</a>

				<h4>A PERFECT TEACHER:</h4>
				<h3> An AI digital assistant </h3>
				<a><p>
					Far too many students sit in a classroom, surrounded by thirty other students, 
					receiving little to no attention from their teacher. At Mobius Education, each child 
					has their own intelligent virtual teacher called MoBi, who guides them through their 
					course until they complete it (with a 100% pass rate per level so there are no learning 
					gaps and the student grasps advanced topics with ease). Mobi ensures the child never feels 
					alone or disorientated. MoBi is like Siri, an intelligent assistant from Apple Inc.1 He has 
					a natural-language user interface.

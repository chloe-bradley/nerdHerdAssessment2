		<h3> <img src="./img/face.png" alt="what"/> Bartlomiej Kubiczek </h3>
		<h2>INTJ – Architect  - 16 Personalities Test</h2>
		<p>Architects put logic before emotion and value truth over opinion, which are very useful and practical traits, 
			but can also hinder relationships among the team, as this personality type may often dismiss opinions and reactions 
			that do not appear rational.</p>
		<p>They like to work alone and out of spotlight when possible, striving for perfection and innovation, 
			which makes them great drivers of growth and creation, that tend to struggle working in a group of people, 
			especially when others are not grasping their concepts or scientific principles behind those.  </p>
			<h2>Learning Style Test - Tactile </h2>
		<p>Tactile or kinesthetic learners learn by touching and doing. Physical movement and “hands-on” 
			experiences that involve building, drawing, and touching allow them to learn the best and the fastest. </p>
		<p>They like to pull things apart, put things together, tinker, improve, optimize, and move around when they 
			do so. Their communication and expression tend to involve a lot of body movement and physical contact as well. </p>
			<h2>Numerical Reasoning Test - 10/10  </h2>
		<p>The 10 out of 10 score simple reveals solid understanding of mathematics and how to create mathematical 
			formulas based on tasks and data provided. It is a great skill to have as an IT engineer. </p>

			contribute any creative solutions. </p>
		<p>They tend to have strong intuition when it comes to human emotion, which makes them very insightful on 
			that part, but also leaves them open to making assumptions. They may be often seen as undecisive or 
			procrastinators if they do not find the career or project that “resonates” with them, but once they do, 
			there is nothing that can stop them from working hard.   </p>

		<h3> Summary </h3>
		<p>As a team we have the advantage of coming from various cultural and ethnical backgrounds, 
			as well possess a range of different life experiences. Normally that can lead to issues in communication, 
			however when well applied it allows us to understand many different demographics and their needs, 
			while minimizing or blind spots.  </p>
		<p>We are all self-motivated, as each person in the group has been intentionally acquiring IT skills 
			regardless of their professional IT career. Majority of the group has working experience within the 
			industry which further contributes to our overall capabilities.  </p>
		<p>Our team profiles reveal very interesting facts about our personalities and how they can affect the 
			team dynamics, however the entire team is aware that it these are not definite statements that we should 
			follow, but indications that can help us refine our teamwork.  </p>
		<p>Looking at the test results we have a lot of strong personalities in our team and the entirety of the 
			group strives to achieve either a greater goal or a greater good, which has allowed us to build a strong 
			momentum ahead of deadlines and refinement of communication over time. We are all focused on the task, 
			value truth, communication, efficiency, and hard work which has allowed us to smoothly divide the tasks. 
			swiftly recover from a loss of team member along the way.   </p>
		<p>Having majority of the group members suitable for leadership also means that even with a loss of current 
			team “manager” or member, the team can quickly recover and complete the assignments before deadline.  </p>
			 <p>All group members are either visual or kinesthetic learners, which are very suitable styles for IT 
				 and will allow us all to thrive in the field. The only downside of it is that we do not have a 
				 great grasp on auditory learners and our project might not cater to them as well as to the other 
				 types of learners.  </p>
